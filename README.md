  ## Description
  On the click of just a few buttons, track exercises by creating and viewing each that you choose on any given day. Log multiple exercises in a workout, as well as many workouts in a day. Keep track of specific data such as date, type of exercise, name, weight, sets, reps and duration. Distance traveled can be tracked as well if the exercise is cardio.
